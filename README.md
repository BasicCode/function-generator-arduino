# Arduino Function Generator

A function / signal generator based on the AD9833 function generator chip. It uses an LCD screen to display a waveform menu and output frequency, and has 5 input buttons (up, down, left, right, select) which are 
used to change frequency and waveform.<br>
The project uses an old (discontinued) LCD screen from 4D systems and so you might want to modify the project with your own LCD and library as needed.<br>
<br>
**NOTE:** This project is still in progress. More detail on the hardware set up to follow.
